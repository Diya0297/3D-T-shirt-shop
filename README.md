# 3D-T-shirt-shop

# 👕 A 3D T-shirt editor where users can:
 🎨 Change the T-shirt’s color in real time
 📌 Add a logo at the center or apply a full texture
 🖱️ Upload their own graphics to add their personal touch 

# 💡 What I learned along the way:
✅ How to set up a Three.js scene with camera, lights, and mesh
 ✅ How to load 3D models (like the T-shirt)
 ✅ How textures and materials work
 ✅ How to add interactive controls like OrbitControls
 ✅ How to add shadows and lights for cool background effects
 ✅ The power of combining ReactJS + Three.js

# ✨ How I approached it:
➡️ I followed tutorial and google searches to understand the Framer motion and Three.js basics.
➡️ I paused often to experiment and break things on purpose, it helped me understand why things worked, not just how.
➡️ I tweaked the project to make it my own, adding custom touches and testing ideas.
